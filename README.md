# Play-By-Play Reader

## Intro 
For the 2019 NBA Hackathon one of the technical questions was to make a script to take play by play data and return the   
Offensive and Defensive Ratings for all players who played in the 2018 playoffs.  

## Required Files

* A Play-by-Play which is formated the same as the Play by Play in the data folder (Play_by_Play.txt)
* A text document that shows all players who appear in the Play by Play and record their unique player id's   
  and the unique team id of the team they play for 

## How to Use 
Run the R Script after placing the play by play and game lineup document in './data/'. A csv file called 'Results.csv'   
will be created with the Offensive and Defensive Ratings of all players and what game those ratings were in. The  
Event_Codes.txt file shows how the "Event_Msg_Type" and "Action_Type" corelate to real life events.
